It's December and just like this, Advent of Code is back! As December also means that my exams are coming up, I won't try to solve the puzzles with a new language this year. Instead, I'll try to create short and sweet solutions in Python.
Also I won't use any AI helpers, so no Copilot, TabNine or ChatGPT for me. 

If you want to try the puzzles yourself, head over to [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).
